Research Question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does altering the distribution of weight on a rotocopter's wings (between the left-to-right-wing-weight ratios ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $>0.14$
\end_inset

), measured in terms of grams, affect the total flight time of the rotocopter, measured in terms of seconds from the instant that the rotocopter is dropped from its initial height of 2.5m to the the time that the rotocopter touched the floor?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the fundamental underpinnings of our world is the idea of flight; the world would not have become as accessible as it is today had there not been the breakthrough discoveries of thrust, lift, drag, and gravity. As our understanding of these factors changed, so too have our vehicles. Humans were able to engineer complex devices like the helicopter, airplane, and hybrids of these devices, and were able to change the ways that flight change. Focusing on the helicopter specifically, some of the properties that have been discovered to change the way that the object flies include the rounding of the wing, sharpness of a wing's rear edge, as well as wing tilt (). Each of these properties link back to the 4 main points, as discussed before, and are simply physical features that affect these mathematical factors. However, the experimenters' interests were piqued when they looked at an image of a helicopter's rotor blades. The blades seemed to be drooping on one side, but remained upright on the other, showing a difference in weight for both of the wings. Each of the aforementioned physical factors were found to affect flight purely through experimentation, and this idea was continued in this experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to understand why helicopter blades drooped down, and explore how weight distribution affects flight, an adequate substitute needed to be found. The ideal substitute was found to be a rotocopter, for its striking relationship to a helicopter. In any flying vehicle, lift is always produced by air passing over some wing (). In a helicopter, the movement of the rotor blades allow for air to pass over them, and the pressure differential between the top of the wing and the bottom is what produces lift (). However, these rotor blades are able to produce lift because of their motorized capabilities; in having a motor, a greater speed can be achieved, which is eventually enough to combat the force of gravity. This allows the helicopter to manoeuvre in specialized ways, such as hovering, going straight up and down, rolling, and tilting forward. A rotocopter, on the other hand, does not have a motor, but it does have the same rotational energy as a helicopter, albeit at a much slower rate. As the wings of the rotocopter rotate, they, much like the helicopter, generate a small amount of lift. However, because of the rotocopter's lack of a motor, it merely combats the strength of gravity, and does not subdue it. This makes the rotocopter an excellent

Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this experiment to understand the effects of weight distribution on flight time within the context of rotocopters. Using a total of 8 staples for each measurement and shifting the ratio of staples per wing will give a greater understanding of how weight

 affects flight, as opposed to merely modulating the weight itself. Moving the metaphorical lens outwards, this experiment will also help develop a basic understanding of real-world flight factors, such as the mechanics behind airplane turning and helicopter lift.

\begin_layout Section
Hypothesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is hypothesized that if the ratio of the weight of the left wing to the right wing of the rotocopter is decreased, then the time taken for the rotocopter to fly from its perch 2.5m above the ground to the ground will

Justification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment's testing procedure mimics the way that weight is distributed among the two wings of an aircraft.

\begin_layout Standard
When an aircraft needs to change directions, it cannot simply move along a vertical axis, as a car would. Instead, it 'banks', using two flaps

Material choice and dimensions of Rotocopter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every material has a certain density associated with it. This means that as the material is changed, the mass of the given rotocopter also changes. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion (recall 
\begin_inset Formula $F=ma$
\end_inset

), a greater mass will result in a 
\series bold
greater time to accelerate to the same speed
\series default
. By extension, this means that a rotocopter with a larger mass would have an ending speed lower than that of a regular mass, thus increasing the flight time for the larger one, and skewing the data in the process

Prescence of air drafts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measured (dependent) variable of the experiment, in a general context, is the time taken for an object to fly from one point to another as a result of some change to the given object. Introducing a headwind or tailwind (two types of air drafts) would change the speed of the object unnaturally, which would lead to a lower or higher speed, respectively. This would cause the timing to be skewed.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Proximity to wall
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to measure the time taken for any object to fall, the object must be able to fall unobstructed. The proximity to any wall is especially important in an experiment of this nature -one dealing primarily with flight-, as flight paths are more often than not unpredictable.

\begin_layout Subsection
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was initially hypothesized that as the weight distribution ratio between the wings was decreased, the flight time would also decrease. In other words, plotting the average flight time of each trial against the ratio of the wing-weight distribution should reveal a negative, linear correlation. This hypothesis was partially supported in the graphs; in Figure 4, it can be seen that the line of best fit (hereon referred to as the LOBF) followed this pattern of a decreasing negative correlation. The data in both Table 1 and Graph 1 showcase this fact, as each of the times are decreasing in correlation with a lower wing-weight ratio. However, the 
\begin_inset Formula $R^2$
\end_inset

 value of the LOBF in Table 1 was about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3$
\end_inset

, which means that it had an accuracy measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm 30\%$
\end_inset

. This was an unacceptable value to draw conclusions from, thus necessitating an adjustment to the LOBF. The experimenters changed the modelling equation from a linear model to a polymnomial one of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, as there was a dip in the data around the 
\begin_inset Formula $2:6$
\end_inset

 ratio measurement. After this was done, the 
\begin_inset Formula $R^2$
\end_inset

 value jumped up to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.95$
\end_inset

, meaning that it was a much more accurate model, as can be seen by the closeness of the points to the curve in Figure 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the jump in the 
\begin_inset Formula $R^2$
\end_inset

 value with the second curve, the polynomial curve was deemed to be the best representation of the data at hand. Analyzing this curve, one can see that there is an 'optimal value' of the graph, whose y-value represents the time taken for the rotocopter to reach the ground, and the x-value representing the ratio of the weight of the left wing to the weight of the right. Coming back to the main point, this graph and optimized data only partially proves the hypothesis. it was stated that there would be a negative 
\shape italic
linear
\shape default
 correlation. The graph proves that there is a point at which the speed simply cannot be increased anymore; in other words, there is a minimum value, which is an idea that is lacking in the linear prediction. However, the graph also shows that there is a general decrease in the times, which confims the first part of the hypothesis, which states that there is a general decrease in the flight times, as the weight ratio between wings decreases.

However, the hypothesis also discussed

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $>0.14$

, on the time taken to fly from one point 2.5m above the ground to the ground. This was done by stapling a total of 8 staples to the wings of the rotocopters, 2
