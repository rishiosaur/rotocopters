\begin_inset Formula $1$

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $>0.14$

), measured in terms of grams, affect the total flight time of the rotocopter, measured in terms of seconds from the instant that the rotocopter is dropped from its initial height of 2.5m to the the time that the rotocopter touched the floor?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the fundamental underpinnings of our world is the idea of flight; the world would not have become as accessible as it is today had there not been the breakthrough discoveries of thrust, lift, drag, and gravity. As our understanding of these factors changed, so too have our vehicles. Humans were able to engineer complex devices like the helicopter, airplane, and hybrids of these devices, and were able to change the ways that flight change. Focusing on the helicopter specifically, some of the properties that have been discovered to change the way that the object flies include the rounding of the wing, sharpness of a wing's rear edge, as well as wing tilt (). Each of these properties link back to the 4 main points, as discussed before, and are simply physical features that affect these mathematical factors. However, the experimenters' interests were piqued when they looked at an image of a helicopter's rotor blades. The blades seemed to be drooping on one side, but remained upright on the other, showing a difference in weight for both of the wings. Each of the aforementioned physical factors were found to affect flight purely through experimentation, and this idea was continued in this experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to understand why different helicopter blades drooped down, and explore how weight distribution affects fligh in the process, an adequate substitute needed to be found. The ideal substitute was found to be a rotocopter, for its striking relationship to a helicopter. In any flying vehicle, lift is always produced by air passing over some wing (). In a helicopter, the movement of the rotor blades allow for air to pass over them, and the pressure differential between the top of the wing and the bottom is what produces lift (). However, these rotor blades are able to produce lift because of their motorized capabilities; in having a motor, a greater speed can be achieved, which is eventually enough to combat the force of gravity. This allows the helicopter to manoeuvre in specialized ways, such as hovering, going straight up and down, rolling, and tilting forward. A rotocopter, on the other hand, does not have a motor, but it does have the same rotational energy as a helicopter, albeit at a much slower rate. As the wings of the rotocopter rotate, they, much like the helicopter, generate a small amount of lift. However, because of the rotocopter's lack of a motor, it merely combats the strength of gravity, and does not subdue it. This makes the rotocopter an excellent subject for understanding the effects of flight;

\begin_layout Section
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this experiment to understand the effects of weight distribution on flight time within the context of rotocopters. Using a total of 8 staples for each measurement and shifting the ratio of staples per wing will give a greater understanding of how weight 
\shape italic

 affects flight, as opposed to merely modulating the weight itself. Moving the metaphorical lens outwards, this experiment will also help develop a basic understanding of real-world flight factors, such as the mechanics behind airplane turning and helicopter lift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Hypothesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is hypothesized that if the wing weight ratio of the rotocopter is decreased, then the time taken for the rotocopter to fly from its perch 2.5m above the ground to the ground will decrease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Justification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Hypothesis Justification"

\end_inset

 This experiment's testing procedure mimics the way that weight is distributed among the two wings of an aircraft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The weight distribution across the wings of the rotocopter will be changed by taking a certain amount of weight from one wing and adding it to the other, which mimics the manner in which a winged aircraft normally turns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking the example of a simple biplane, turning is not achieved by rotating about the 'z' axis, as a car would, but rather by turning about the 'x' axis, using a technique known as 'banking'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to turn an airplane, flaps on the wings known as ailerons are rotated, which affects the airflow passing over the wing. This modified airflow creates a pressure differential above and below the wing in question, which can create or take away lift. This idea can be thought of as putting weight on a certain wing, allowing the airplane to turn, as can be seen in Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that as an airplane rolls, its altitude decreases correspondingly, as the total lift on the airplane is no longer facing upwards. In order for the airplane's altitude to stay constant, more speed must be applied to it, so that more airflow can be applied to the wings, and thus creating lift. In essence, as the bank of an aircraft changes, the speed increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This same principle can be applied to this experiment, as in order to change the weight distribution of a rotocopter, weight must be taken from one wing and added to the other. This is much like the way that an airplane banks, but using physical weights as opposed to air. As a result, it can be assumed that the 'bank' angle of the rotocopter will change in correlation with a decrease in the ratio of the weights of the rotocopter's wings (i.e. a rotocopter with weight ratio 4:4 would be perfectly level, but a rotocopter with weight ratio 0:8 would heavily lean towards the side).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as the increase of a bank angle in an aircraft causes a corresponding change in the speed of that aircraft, it can also be assumed that this property follows through in rotocopters as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stated previously, a rotocopter with weight ratio 4:4 would be level, but a rotocopter with weight ratio 0:8 would heavily lean towards the side, indicating a negative linear relationship
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard
Note that it is assumed to be linear because all the possible shifts in the wing weight ratio (4:4, 3:5, 2:6, 1:7, etc.) all have equal increments, which follow a linear pattern
\end_layout

\end_inset

 between the amount of time taken to fly from the perch to the ground and the wing weight ratio; as the wing weight ratio decreases, the speed increases, which decreases the amount of time taken to cross a given distance.

Material choice and dimensions of Rotocopter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every material has a certain density associated with it. This means that as the material is changed, the mass of the given rotocopter also changes. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion (recall 
\begin_inset Formula $F=ma$
\end_inset

), a greater mass will result in a 
\series bold
greater time to accelerate to the same speed
\series default
. By extension, this means that a rotocopter with a larger mass would have an ending speed lower than that of a regular mass, thus increasing the flight time for the larger one, and skewing the data in the process

Prescence of air drafts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measured (dependent) variable of the experiment, in a general context, is the time taken for an object to fly from one point to another as a result of some change to the given object. Introducing a headwind or tailwind (two types of air drafts) would change the speed of the object unnaturally, which would lead to a lower or higher speed, respectively. This would cause the timing to be skewed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Proximity to wall
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to measure the time taken for any object to fall, the object must be able to fall unobstructed. The proximity to any wall is especially important in an experiment of this nature -one dealing primarily with flight-, as flight paths are more often than not unpredictable.

Results and Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fitting the model and initial comparison with hypothesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was initially hypothesized that as the wing weight ratio of a rotocopter was decreased, the flight time would also decrease. In other words, plotting the average flight time of a given rotocopter against its wing weight ratio should reveal a negative, linear correlation. This hypothesis was not supported in the graphs; in Figure 4, it can be seen that the line of best fit (hereon referred to as the LOBF) followed this pattern of a decreasing negative correlation. The data in both Table 1 and Graph 1 showcase this fact, as each of the times are decreasing in correlation with a lower wing-weight ratio. However, the 
\begin_inset Formula $R^2$
\end_inset

 value of the LOBF in Table 1 was about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3$
\end_inset

, which means that it had an accuracy measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm 30\%$
\end_inset

. This was an unacceptable value to draw conclusions from, thus necessitating an adjustment to the LOBF. The experimenters changed the modelling equation from a linear model to a polymnomial one of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, as there was a dip in the data around the 
\begin_inset Formula $2:6$
\end_inset

 ratio measurement. After this was done, the 
\begin_inset Formula $R^2$
\end_inset

 value jumped up to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.95$
\end_inset

, meaning that it was a much more accurate model, as can be seen by the closeness of the points to the curve in Figure 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Qualities of Polynomial Curve
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the jump in the 
\begin_inset Formula $R^2$
\end_inset

 value with the second curve, the polynomial curve was deemed to be the best representation of the data at hand. Analyzing this curve, one can see that there is an 'optimal value' of the graph, whose y-value represents the time taken for the rotocopter to reach the ground, and the x-value representing the ratio of the weight of the left wing to the weight of the right. Coming back to the main point, this graph and optimized data only partially proves the hypothesis. it was stated that there would be a negative 
\shape italic
linear
\shape default
 correlation. The graph proves that there is a point at which the speed simply cannot be increased anymore; in other words, there is a minimum value. This point is further discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

. This quadratic relation also showed that the two maximum values of the dataset were the two extreme ratios; the wing weight ratios of

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 The findings in the quantitative data were supported by the visuals found in the qualitative data. At the beginnning of the procedure, when the testing of control group began, it can be seen that the rotocopter is spinning and gliding down at a relatively low speed (See file 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

verb|IMG_3695.mov|
\end_layout

\end_inset

), and this effect is mimicked in the later stages of the experiment. In the testing of the last ratio (8 staples on the left wing, 0 on the right), it can be seen that the rotocopter did not spin, but glided down at a rate similar to the first one. In the parabola shown in (graph), it can also be seen that the lowest time taken to fly from the 
\begin_inset Formula $2.5\pm0.05$

m starting point to the landing point on the ground was achieved by the rotocopter with wing ratios of 
\begin_inset Formula $2:6$

, which was perfectly in the middle of all the trials, which took about

seconds. In the footage (See file

 simply fell to the ground, as opposed to gracefully gliding down to the surface in the same manner as the other trials.

Possible Errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the data being quite precise (the ranges in Figure 4 are all relatively small), there could still have been both systematic and random errors made in the collection process, which might have skewed the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Systematic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the major factors affecting flight is wind, as it pushes air at either a greater or lower speed, depending on the type. This affects flight time readings for small objects much more; as a result of their small mass, objects like paper rotocopters are much more finicky. Although the experiment was conducted in a section of a hallway, there were still numerous possible sources of wind. In the experiment space, there were doors that were being opened and closed repeatedly, whose motion could've caused wind. In addition, the experimenters did not have any coverings over their mouths, so heavy breathing could've also affected the measurements through the air produced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there may also have been errors in the technology used. For the initial experiment, the experimenters used a 2019 iPhone XR camera, which shot at approximately 30 frames per second, at a resolution of 1080p. This means that every 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{30}$
\end_inset

 seconds, a moment in time is captured. In some cases, the time that the rotocopter first touched the ground was in between these 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{30}$
\end_inset

 second increments, which could've skewed the final data. In addition to this, there is a certain amount of delay between the pressing of the 'start recording' button and the time that the camera actually starts recording. This tiny amount of delay could've easily thrown off the measurements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Random
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of averaging the values, many of the random errors were filtered out. However, there were still some random errors in the experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible error could've been in the process of creating the rotocopters themselves. Each of the rotocopter templates required precise measurements and cutting of the paper, and owing to the rotocopter's small size, any miniscule mistake would have relatively large implications. For instance, if there was a rip in the paper around the centre of the copter, then air would be able to flow through that space, allowing the object to drop down faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing on the point of human error, mistakes could also have been made in the experimentation process. The procedure states that humans dropped and interacted with all of the experimental objects. Humans can clearly see objects down to 
\begin_inset space ~

\end_inset

0.026mm when the object is 
\begin_inset space ~

\end_inset

15cm away from the eye in question (cite). As such, the process of dropping the rotocopter from a fixed height was not entirely precise. This problem of human accuracy could also have translated in the data collection of the experiment, through the time that the recording of footage began. In the procedure, it is noted in step () that the recording of the trial was started as soon as the person standing on the chair dropped the rotocopter

 or some other keyword. As a result, this part of the experiment relies mostly on the reflex time of each of the individuals conducting the experiment; the person dropping the copter has to react to their dropping, then say a keyword, then the individual who is recording must then react to the keyword, and then start recording. Each of these steps take place in succession, adding to the amount of time it takes for the rotocopter's

\begin_layout Subsection
Improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As was demonstrated by the high amount of possible systematic and random errors in the experiment, there were numerous ways that the experiment could've been improved, starting with the human interactions. Obviously, our bodies are not necessarily suited to measure items with precision, so if this experiment were to be repeated, the humans would need to be replaced by machines, and more accurate devices. For instance, a robot arm could be used instead of a human to drop the rotocopter, ensuring a constant drop height. This arm could also be linked to the record button on the camera, or be linked to an automation system that starts recording on drop.

Conclusion

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, the purpose of this experiment was to understand the effects of weight distribution of the wings of a rotocopter, between ratios ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $>0.14$
\end_inset

, on the time taken to fly from one point 2.5m above the ground to the ground. This was done by stapling a total of 8 staples to the wings of the rotocopters, 2

0.05cm away from a given wing's edge, with each trial having a different ratio of staples
